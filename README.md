I created this repo because encrypted data is an **EPIC** issue and affects many other projects. Hopefuly other IPFS members can contribute to the discussion.

Everything is maintained in the [issues](https://github.com/richardschneider/ipfs-encryption/issues). Feel free to add your comments or raise new issues.
