# ipfs-encryption
Encrypting IPFS data. Start with the [**big picture**](https://github.com/richardschneider/ipfs-encryption/issues/3) and then the [smaller picture](https://github.com/richardschneider/ipfs-encryption/issues/8).

I created this repo because encrypted data is an **EPIC** issue and affects many other projects. Hopefuly other IPFS members can contribute to the discussion.

Everything is maintained in the [issues](https://github.com/richardschneider/ipfs-encryption/issues). Feel free to add your comments or raise new issues.

Keystore implementations
- JS is [here](https://github.com/richardschneider/ipfs-encryption/blob/master/src/keystore.md) and as always a WIP
- CS coming real soon
